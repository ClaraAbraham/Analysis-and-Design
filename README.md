# Analysis-and-Design 

# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course? 
The problem that I was trying to solve in the projects for this course was to write a program that prints a course list and allows a user to search for a particular course to print. 

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand. 
I approached the problem by analyzing pseudocode and a runtime analysis to determine which data structure would be the best choice. According to the pseudocode that I wrote and the runtime analysis that I made, the best data structure to use is binary search tree. However, when I began to type the code for the program, I used a vector because I am better at using syntax pertaining to the vector data structure.  

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project? 
When I came upon a roadblock, I put a Fixme in-line comment where I got stuck and then came back to do it afterwards. Just like how on a test, if I were to get stuck on a question, I would temporarily skip it and then come back to it afterwards. 

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs? 
My work on this project expanded my approach to designing software by giving me a curriculum to learn. In other words, learning according to a curriculum is more structured and clear than teaching myself.  

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 
My work on this project was readable because I included descriptive names for variables and functions. My work was also adaptable because a lot of the variables are reusable.
